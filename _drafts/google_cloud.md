## ¿Qué es Qwiklabs?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIyJ_bboIR0
Qwiklabs es una plataforma de aprendizaje sobre servicios de Cloud Computing: Amazon Web Services (AWS) y Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Está basada en laboratorios prácticos que se realizan sobre cuentas temporales de estos proveedores de Cloud Pública. Qwiklabs fue creada en 2012 y adquirida por Google en 2016. A pesar de ello, sigue manteniendo laboratorios de AWS, bastantes de ellos gratuitos.

# [PATH 1] Getting Started with Google Cloud Learning Path 
Get started with Google Cloud training by completing this learning path that introduces you to the fundamentals of Google Cloud. https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/paths/8

1. [LAB 1] A Tour of Google Cloud Hands-on Labs
1. [QUEST 1] Create and Manage Cloud Resources
1. [COURSE 1] Google Cloud Fundamentals: Core Infrastructure
1. [QUEST 2] Perform Foundational Infrastructure Tasks in Google Cloud
1. [COURSE 2] Google Cloud Big Data and Machine Learning Fundamentals
1. [QUEST 3] Perform Foundational Data, ML, and AI Tasks in Google Cloud


## [LAB 1] A Tour of Google Cloud Hands-on Labs

* **Google Cloud Project (GCP)** is an organizing entity for your Google Cloud resources. It often contains resources and services; for example, it may hold a pool of virtual machines, a set of databases, and a network that connects them together. Projects also contain settings and permissions, which specify security rules and who has access to what resources.

* Qwiklabs Resources

* A **Project ID** is a unique identifier that is used to link Google Cloud resources and APIs to your specific project. Project IDs are unique across Google Cloud: there can be only one qwiklabs-gcp-xxx...., which makes it globally identifiable.

* **Cloud Identity and Access Management (Cloud IAM)** service. This identity has access permissions (a role or roles) that allow you to work with Google Cloud resources in the project you've been allocated. These credentials are temporary and will only work for the access time of the lab. When the timer reaches 00:00:00, you will no longer have access to your Google Cloud project with those credentials. https://cloud.google.com/iam/

* **Google Cloud services**:
* Compute: A variety of machine types that support any type of workload. The different computing options let you decide how much control you want over operational details and infrastructure.
* Storage: Data storage and database options for structured or unstructured, relational or non relational data.
* Networking: Services that balance application traffic and provision security rules.
* Cloud Operations: A suite of cross-cloud logging, monitoring, trace, and other service reliability tools.
* Tools: Services that help developers manage deployments and application build pipelines.
* Big Data: Services that allow you to process and analyze large datasets.
* Artificial Intelligence: A suite of APIs that run specific artificial intelligence and machine learning tasks on Google Cloud.
