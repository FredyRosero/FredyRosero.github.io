This (ISC)2 credential denotes cybersecurity expertise and years of experience. Earning the CISSP certification has been compared to earning a master’s degree in IT security, as it proves professionals have what it takes to effectively design, implement and manage a cybersecurity program.

The CISSP exam is based around eight domains in information security:

* Security and Risk Management
* Asset Security
* Security Architecture and Engineering
* Communication and Network Security
* Identity and Access Management (IAM)
* Security Assessment and Testing
* Security Operations
* Software Development Security

To achieve this certification, candidates also need at least five years of paid, relevant work experience in two or more of the CISSP domains.

If you lack the necessary experience, you can still take the certification exam and become an Associate of (ISC)2 if you pass. Then, you’ll have up to six years to obtain the required experience to earn your CISSP.
