# Is the CISSP Right for Me?
To qualify for the CISSP, candidates must pass the exam and have at least five years of cumulative, paid work experience in two or more of the eight
domains of the (ISC)² CISSP Common Body of Knowledge (CBK®).

1. Security and Risk Management
1. Asset Security
1. Security Architecture and Engineering
1. Communication and Network Security
1. Identity and Access Management (IAM)
1. Security Assessment and Testing
1. Security Operations
1. Software Development Security

A candidate who doesn’t yet have the required experience to become a CISSP may become an Associate of (ISC)² after successfully passing the
CISSP exam. The Associate of (ISC)² will then have six years to earn the experience needed for CISSP certification.
